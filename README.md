# nix-koans
Simple koans for learning nix. Inspired by [ruby koans](https://www.rubykoans.com).

## Getting started

Check your progress with `nix develop -c check`. Edit files in `koans/` directory. Make one pass, refactor, move on to the next :)

Reset with `nix develop -c reset`.

## Direnv

If you have [direnv](direnv.net), take a look at`.envrc.suggested` to get better shell experience.

# nix-koans
Simple koans for learning nix. Inspired by [ruby koans](https://www.rubykoans.com).

New to nix? Start [here](nix_INTRO.md).

## Getting started

Start by running `nix develop -c reset` - this will create `koans/` directory. Edit `1_01` to make it pass.

Check your progress with `nix develop -c check`. Make another one pass, refactor, move on to the next :)

Reset with `nix develop -c reset`.

## Direnv

If you have [direnv](direnv.net), take a look at`.envrc.suggested` to get better shell experience.
